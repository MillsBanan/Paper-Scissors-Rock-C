Date:     10/10/19


... Game Description ...

This game gives players the freedom to compete in a classic match
of Paper Scissors Rock, without the need for flailing their arms around.
The format is best of two, meaning players will have to duel it out until
one of them has won two games.

The navswitch on the UCFK is all the player needs to control their actions
in this game. The progress of the game will be displayed on the LED screen.

Navswitch Left/Right    -->     Scroll through actions on game display
Navswitch Push          -->     Select option / Move to next screen
